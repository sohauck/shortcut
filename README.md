firstofeach: gives list of rows for each first occurrence of value in chosen column
listofusableloci: removes loci where not every entry is an integer
NEXcolour: switches the colour of point labels in a NEX file as per conversion list
NEXswap: switches labels in NEXUS format matrix files 
separate-lineages-s2: assigns new lineages based on pairwise distances and known lineages
splitXMFA: splits a XMFA file produced by BIGSDB GC alignment into one file per locus
subtractlist: removes items present in a second list from a first list

(work together)
annotation-cutdown: keeps only relevant lines (for CDS extraction) from genome annotation
FASTAextract: splits concatenated FASTA into ID tab CDS
